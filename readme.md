## StopWatch application in React

### What the app does
* A fully functioning React stopwatch application, with child components that render the stopwatch, in addition to splits/laps in a list on the page. The app is served up with an Express backend using express-generator (runs on a local server via npm) and is styled with CSS.  

### Running the app
* Open a command line window and run the backend server by typing ```PORT=3001 npm start``` to boot up the server from the root directory.
* Open a second command line window, change directory (cd) into the client/ folder and type ```npm start``` to boot up the react app.
